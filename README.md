# Week2-Submission

https://ksubi1x.github.io/Week2-Submission/


The purpose of this project was to make my own portfolio type of website to match the template that was given to us.
As you can see though, what I made doesn't match what we were given to copy.
I might get failed for that though but I just decided to take my own route and see what I could do on my own, 
and also because I wanted to get better at using HTML and CSS. I thought that doing my own thing would help get a better understanding 
at using HTML and CSS since I would have to come up with a whole layout myself and align stuff on my own.
